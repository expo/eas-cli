# Releasing EAS CLI

1. Invoke the GitHub workflow ["Manually trigger a release"](https://github.com/expo/eas-cli/actions/workflows/trigger-release.yml). The next version is chosen automatically based on the changelog entries. If you want to use different version, pass the version string as an input to the workflow, in semver format, e.g. "1.2.3"
2. That's it! GitHub Actions is going to take care of the rest. Watch the #eas-cli Slack channel for a successful release notification.

## Choosing the next version

As stated above, the next EAS CLI version is chosen automatically based on the existing changelog entries under the unreleased section in **CHANGELOG.md**.

The algorithm works as follows:

- If there are any entries in the "🛠 Breaking changes" section, bump the MAJOR version.
- Otherwise, if there are any entries in the "🎉 New features", bump the MINOR version.
- Otherwise, bump the PATCH version.
